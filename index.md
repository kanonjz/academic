Hi there! I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, advised by Prof. [Hong Xu](https://henryhxu.github.io/) at CUHK and Prof. [Chun Jason Xue](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~jasonxue/) at CityU. I'm also fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/index.html) at UCSD.

My research interests lie in building networked systems, with a primary focus in video analytics/streaming system, edge computing, and mobile computing.
